RESUME RE-CHALLENGE

So you knocked out the Code School course. Awesome! Now lets take another crack at that resume employing the skills you just learned. Additionally, so much of what is important in software development, is understanding what the code is doing and speaking to the decisions that you made in your code. So after you overhaul your resume challenge a bit, I want you to do a small write up on what you changed and why.

What to do:

Enhance your resume with however you see fit based off what you learned this week. Keep a log of changes that you made that will help support your written portion of this assignment.

Recommit your work to GitHub Pages so that I can review what you have completed.

Email me what you changed about your resume styling and presentation, make sure to give it the subject "RESUME CHALLENGE - <>". In talking about what you changed, make sure to talk about what things might have been 'new learnings' for you and why you decided to integrate them into your existing resume.
